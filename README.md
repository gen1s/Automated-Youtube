# Automated-Youtube
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Make sure that you create a folder named "memes" and another one named "output""
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


With this simple python script you are able to automate an entire youtube channel.


1 - It will scrape videos from a given subreddit and will download them on your "memes" folder.

2 - It will merge all the non corrupted videos into 1 single video. This video is saved on your "output" folder.

3 - It will upload the video to youtube.


Thats all.

You just need to run the script and in a few minutes the video will be uploaded to youtube.
